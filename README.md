# NewRepo_Fenna
test

NewRepo_Fenna started by Fenna. I called the "master" branch "branch1". I created two files (newfile.R and newfile1.1.R) and made a local branch (branch1_fmkprivate). My private branch has some changes to those files, which have not been pulled to branch1. 

Then, I invited arpy to collaborate on NewRepo_Fenna.

We should test:
1. What happens when Arpy makes a change to newfile.R?
2. What happens when Arpy makes his own new file and adds it to this NewRepo_Fenna?
